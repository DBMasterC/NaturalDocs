_______________________________________________________________________________


Topic: POD Documentation

	Natural Docs will read POD comments in "=begin nd" sections and treat them the same as any other documentation comments.
	You can also substitute "naturaldocs" or "natural docs" for "nd" and it's not case-sensitive.  Like regular comments they must
	also include topic lines, or if Perl has full language support appear directly above a code element.

	Natural Docs will also read POD comment sections which uses just the shorthand "=nd" or any of the substitutions, though this
	is not valid POD.  It's valid Perl so the scripts will execute just fine, but using this method may cause POD parsers to become
	confused and include some of the unformatted text in their output.

	Natural Docs also supports "=pod begin nd" and its substitutions, though this generally isn't mentioned in the documentation.
	This is because that syntax was a mistake made early on and so it's only included for backwards compatibility.  Its use should
	not be encouraged.

	Natural Docs will also read POD comments in "=begin jd" or "=begin javadoc" sections and treate them the same as Javadoc
	comments.  It also supports the "=jd" and "=javadoc" shorthand.

	All other POD sections are ignored.  Recognized sections do not have to appear alone, so a POD comment can start with
	"=pod", go to "=begin nd", and then go back to "=pod" without a "=cut" in between.  Multiple consecutive recognized sections
	are treated as separate comments.
