		For each file it first stores its ID number, its absolute path, and its <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Files.FileType>.
		
		Then it stores the last modification time in ticks.  If the file wasn't fully processed when Natural Docs shut down, 
		either due to a change or a deletion, the tick count will be zero to indicate that it should be processed again.

		Next it stores the character encoding ID, or zero if it should auto-detect its Unicode encoding or it's not a text file.  
		Auto-detection is the default and should handle all forms of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.  Other values correspond
		to the code page identifier which can be passed directly to System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(int32).

		If the file is an image, it will then be followed by the width and height of the image in pixels, or zero if it's not known.
		
		This continues until there is an ID number of zero.

	Topic: 2.2

		- Added Character Encoding ID.

	Topic: 2.1

		- No changes to the file format, but 2.1 actually determines image dimensions.  When reading files from earlier
		  versions you should make sure they're reparsed.
		
	Topic: 2.0.2

		- Added dimensions for image files.  They will always be zero because image file support was only partially
		  implemented and it would have been too much effort to back it out for 2.0.2.
		
	Topic: 2.0

		- The file was introduced.
