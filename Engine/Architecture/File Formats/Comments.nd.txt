
File: Comments.nd
_______________________________________________________________________________

A binary file which stores the combined results of the two versions of <Comments.txt> as of the last run, as well as storing
the IDs of each type so they maintain their consistency between runs.

	Topic: Header

 		> [[Binary Header]]

 		The file starts with the standard binary file header as managed by <BinaryFile at CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.BinaryFile>.


	Topic: Tags

 		> [String: Tag Name]
 		> [Int32: ID]
 		> ...
 		> [String: null]

 		The file then has pairs of tag names and IDs until it reaches a null string.


	Topic: Comment Types

 		> [String: Comment Type Name]
 		> [[Comment Type Attributes]]
 		> ...
 		> [String: null]

 		The file then encodes each comment type by its name string, followed by its attributes, and repeats until it reaches a null
 		string instead of a new name string.

 		> Comment Type Attributes:
 		> [Int32: ID]
 		> [String: Display Name]
 		> [String: Plural Display Name]
 		> [String: Simple Identifier]
 		> [Byte: Scope]
		> [Int32: Hierarchy ID or 0 if none]
 		> [Byte: Flags]

 		The attributes include strings for the display and plural display names.  These are the computed strings, so if they
 		weren't defined they'll still be here via whatever inheritance rules are in play.  If it's defined by the locale, it's the
 		resulting string that was retrieved from it.

		The value of Scope directly maps to the values of
		<CommentType.ScopeValue at CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CommentTypes.CommentType.ScopeValue>,
		and the value of Flags directly maps to the values of
		<CommentType.FlagValue at CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.CommentTypes.CommentType.FlagValue>.


	Topic: Keyword Definitions

 		> [String: Keyword]
 		> [[Keyword Definition Attributes]]
 		> ...
 		> [String: null]

 		The file then encodes each keyword definition by its keyword string, followed by its attributes, and repeats until it
		reaches a null string instead of a new keyword string.  There may be multiple definitions of the same keyword string
		as some may be language-specific variants.  However, any keywords that match an Ignore Keywords section in
		<Comments.txt> will be excluded.

		> Keyword Definition Attributes:
		> [Byte: Plural (0 or 1)]
		> [Int32: Comment Type ID]
		> [Int32: Language ID or 0 if agnostic]

	Topic: 2.2

		- Removed comment type attributes Index, Index With ID, and Break Lists.
		- Flags is now a byte instead of UInt16.
		- Hierarchy ID was moved out of Flags into it's own value.
		- The Keywords section is revamped, allowing language-specific keywords and combining the singular/plural lists into
		  one.
		- Removed the Ignored Keywords section.  Ignored keywords will be reflected by omissions from the keywords list.

 	Topic: 2.0

 		- The file is introduced.
