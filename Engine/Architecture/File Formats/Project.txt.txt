_______________________________________________________________________________

The configuration file that defines the project settings for Natural Docs.  Various settings may be overridden by the command
line, though.

These files follows the standard conventions in <ConfigFile>.  Identifier whitespace is condensed.  Y, N, True, and False can 
be substituted for Yes and No.

	Topic: Project Information
		
		> Title: [title]
		> Subtitle: [subtitle]
		> Copyright: [copyright]

		The title, subtitle, and copyright notice for the project.  (C), (R), and (TM) will be converted into their respective symbols.
			
		> Timestamp: [timestamp code]
			
		The timestamp code is a regular string with the following subsitutions performed:
			
			m - Single digit month, when possible.  January is "1".
			mm - Always double digit month.  January is "01".
			mon - Short month word.  January is "Jan".
			month - Long month word.  January is "January".
			d - Single digit day, when possible.  1 is "1".
			dd - Always double digit day.  1 is "01".
			day - Day with text extension.  1 is "1st".
			yy - Double digit year.  2021 is "21".
			yyyy - Four digit year.  2021 is "2021".
			year - Four digit year.  2021 is "2021".
			
		Anything else is left literal in the output.  The substitution requires a non-letter on each side, so every m will not turn into
		the month.
			
		> Style: [name]
			
		The style to apply to all output targets.

		> Home Page: [file]

		The file that should serve as the home page.  This could be a source file in one of the input targets, or a HTML file in any
		location.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.

 
	Topic: Input Targets

		> Source Folder: [path]
		> Source Folder [number]: [path]
		>    Name: [name]
				
		Specifies a source folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		A number can optionally be specified.  If one is not, it uses the lowest number not in use by another source folder.  Each
		folder must have a unique number.
			
		Name can optionally be specified.  It's not required if there is only one source folder.  If there's more than one and it's 
		not specified it will be automatically generated.
			
		> Image Folder: [path]
		> Image Folder [number]: [path]
			
		Specifies an image folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		A number can optionally be specified.  If one is not, it uses the lowest number not in use by another image folder.  Each
		folder must have a unique number.
			
 
	Topic: Filters
		
		> Ignore Source Folder: [path]
			
		Specifies a source folder that should not be scanned for files.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		> Ignore Source Folder Pattern: [pattern]
			
		Specifies a pattern that should cause a source folder to be ignored if it matches.  ? matches a single character, * matches 
		zero or more characters.  It applies to the entire folder name, so "cli" will not match "client", although "cli*" will.
			
 
	Topic: Output Targets
 
		> HTML Output Folder: [path]
		>    [Project Info Settings]
			
		Specifies a HTML output folder.  Relative paths are relative to the project folder.
			
		Each folder may override any of the project information settings if desired.  This allows projects with multiple output targets
		to give each one its own style, subtitle, etc.
			
		Although internally output targets have numbers like input targets, they're not stored in this file because it's not important
		for them to remain consistent from one computer to the next.  They're only used for temporary data, whereas input target
		numbers affect the generated output file paths (/files2, etc.) and thus need to remain consistent so URLs don't constantly
		change.
			
 
	Topic: Global Settings
 
		> Tab Width: [width]
			
		The number of spaces a tab should be expanded to.
			
		> Documented Only: [yes|no]
			
		Whether only documented code elements should appear in the output.
			
		> Auto Group: [yes|no]
			
		Whether automatic grouping should be applied.
