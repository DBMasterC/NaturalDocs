_______________________________________________________________________________

A binary file which stores some of the previous settings of <Project.txt>.  Only settings relevant to the global operation of 
the program are stored.  Information that is only relevant to the output targets is not because whether a change is significant
and what its effects are are dependent on the targets themselves.  They are expected to track any changes that are relevant
themselves.

		A segment of data for each target.  They each start with a type string and the following properties and their encodings
		are specific to the type.  Segments continue until a null identifier is reached.
			

		Source Folders:

		> [String: Target Type="Source Folder"]
		> [String: Absolute Path]
		> [Int32: Number]
			
		The Name property isn't stored because that's only used for presentation in the output.
		

		Image Folders:

		> [String: Target Type="Image Folder"]
		> [String: Absolute Path]
		> [String: Number]


		Source Filters:
			
		Filter targets are not stored.  When a filter is changed from one run to the next the effects will be reflected in the file
		scans, so there is no need to detect it separately.
			

		Output Folders:

		> [String: Target Type="HTML Output Folder"]
		> [String: Absolute Path]
		> [Int32: Number]
			
		A new output target requires a full rebuild, and knowing its number is important for allowing it to keep intermediate data.
		Project information like Title is not stored, either at the global or output target level, as it is only relevant to the output 
		targets.
