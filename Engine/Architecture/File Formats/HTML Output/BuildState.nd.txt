		> [[Binary Header]]
		
		The file starts with the standard binary file header as managed by <BinaryFile>.

		> [Byte: Need to Build Frame Page (0 or 1)]
		> [Byte: Need to Build Home Page (0 or 1)]
		> [Byte: Need to Build Main Style Files (0 or 1)]
		> [Byte: Need to Build Menu (0 or 1)]
		> [Byte: Need to Build Main Search Files (0 or 1)]
		
		Flags for some of the structural items that need to be built.

		> [NumberSet: Source File IDs to Rebuild]
		> [NumberSet: Class IDs to Rebuild]
		> [NumberSet: Image File IDs to Rebuild]
		> [NumberSet: Style File IDs to Rebuild]
		
		The files that needed to be rebuilt but weren't yet.  If the last build was run to completion these should 
		be empty sets, though if the build was interrupted this will have the ones left to do.
		
		> [NumberSet: Source File IDs with Content]
		> [NumberSet: Class IDs with Content]
		
		A set of all the source and class files known to have content after all filters were applied.
		
		> [NumberSet: Used Image File IDs]
		
		A set of all the image file IDs which were used in the output.
		
		> [NumberSet: Unchanged Image File Use Check IDs]
		
		A set of all the image file IDs that haven't changed but whether they're used in the output may have.
		
		> [StringSet: Search Prefixes to Rebuild]
		
		A set of all the search index prefixes which were changed or deleted and thus need to be rebuilt.
 
		> [StringSet: Folders to Check for Deletion]
		
		A set of all folders which have had files removed and thus should be removed if empty.  If the last build was run
		to completion this should be an empty set.
		
		> [String: File Menu Data File Identifier] [NumberSet: File Menu Data File Numbers]
 
		> [Int32: Hierarchy ID] [String: Menu Data File Identifier] [NumberSet: Menu Data File Numbers]
		> [Int32: Hierarchy ID] [String: Menu Data File Identifier] [NumberSet: Menu Data File Numbers]
		> ...
		> [Int32: 0]
		
		File identifiers and <NumberSets> of the data files that were created when the menus were built, so if the file
		menu created files.js, files2.js, and files3.js, it will store "files" and {1-3}.  This allows us to clean up old data 
		files if we're using fewer than before.  Hierarchy menus are stored as Int32-String-NumberSet groups that repeat 
		until there's a hierarchy ID of zero.
		
		> [String: Path to Home Page or null]
		
		The custom home page file, or null if using the default.
		
		> [String: Generated Timestamp or null]
		
		The timestamp used the last time the output was built.  This is the generated result, so "Updated January 1, 2020", 
		and not the code like "Updated month d, yyyy".
		
		> [Byte: Home Page Uses Timestamp (0 or 1)]
		
		Whether the home page uses the generated timestamp or not.
