_______________________________________________________________________________

	Topic: Content ToolTips

		A file is generated that contains the tooltips to every link that appears in a content file.  It is stored in a separate file
		instead of being appended to the content so that the page will finish loading and fire its OnLoad() handler without waiting
		for the tooltip information which may be large and slow it down.

		The file is in the same folder as the generated HTML and shares the same name except ending with -ToolTips.js.  So for
		SourceFile-cs.html the tooltips file will be SourceFile-cs-ToolTips.js.

		The file contains a call to NDContentPage.OnToolTipsLoaded(), passing the content as a hash that maps the numeric
		topic IDs to the tooltip HTML:

		> NDContentPage.OnToolTipsLoaded({
		>    1234: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>",
		>    1235: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>",
		>    1236: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>"
		>    });

		The file is not linked to the page automatically, so if it's desired the content page's JavaScript must load it manually.


	Topic: Summary ToolTips

		A similar file is generated that contains the tooltips to every entry that appears in a content file's summary.  It is also stored
		in a separate file but with a -SummaryToolTips.js extension.  In this case it's a separate file so that the summary data file can
		be loaded and the summary generated quickly, as the tooltips may be large and would slow it down.

		The call is to NDSummary.OnToolTipsLoaded() but it is otherwise the same as the content tooltips file:

		> NDSummary.OnToolTipsLoaded({
		>    1234: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>",
		>    1235: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>",
		>    1236: "<div class=\"NDToolTip\">...</div>"
		>    });
