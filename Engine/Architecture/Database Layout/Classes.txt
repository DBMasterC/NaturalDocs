
Database Table: CodeDB.Classes
_______________________________________________________________________________

The table that contains all of the classes used by <Topics>.  The Classes table also represents other hierarchies
such as databases.



Group: Columns
_______________________________________________________________________________


Database Column: ClassID

	--- Prototype ---
		ClassID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL
	-----------------

	The class identifier.


Database Column: ClassString

	--- Prototype ---
		ClassString TEXT
	-----------------

	The class information encoded with <CodeClear.NaturalDocs.Engine.Symbols.ClassString>.  If this is the same
	as <LookupKey> this will be null to reduce memory use.  Retrieve it using "ifnull(ClassString, LookupKey)" or
	"coalesce(ClassString, LookupKey)" in the select statement.


Database Column: LookupKey

	--- Prototype ---
		LookupKey TEXT NOT NULL
	-----------------

	This is the same as <ClassString>, except that if the language is case insensitive the symbol portion will be in
	lowercase.  You look up records with this key to allow for case insensitivity but you use <ClassString> so you
	can preserve the case as it was entered.


Database Column: ReferenceCount

	--- Prototype ---
		ReferenceCount INTEGER NOT NULL
	-----------------

	The number of times this class is used.



Group: Indexes
_______________________________________________________________________________


Database Index: ClassesByID

	--- Prototype ---
		ClassID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL
	-----------------

	Automatically created by ClassID being defined as a primary key.


Database Index: ClassesByLookupKey

	--- Prototype ---
		CREATE INDEX ClassesByLookupKey ON Classes (LookupKey)
	-----------------
